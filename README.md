# emoTracker
Emotional tracker built with Node.js with express framework.
The app features user auth to be able to pick daily emotion. 
The data is store in three forms: 

weekly emotions ordared by day 
All emotions 
I utilized a dependency called chart.js to display the emotions that tha user have picked the most.This dependicy passes the information by making a http request to the backend to retrived the user information. The other views feature all emotions buy simple route reaching with date management with SQL

The idea of this full stack application is to keep track of emotions by a simple picker 
later feather such as comments will be added.
